Generate random fake rocks, from random locations around the world. Rocks may taste like chicken.

To use:
1) npm install random-rocks
2) require 'random-rocks' and assign to variable
e.g. const rocky = require('random-rocks')
3) use that variable to invoke random-rocks, add whatever number of rocks you want as an argument
e.g. rocky(4) //4 random rocks! (and the best of Rocky)
